## Audacity .pot file

This repository contains the `audacity.pot` translation file, built on a regular schedule (see [`update-pot.yml`](https://github.com/mlocati/audacity-pot/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-pot.yml)).

The generated `audacity.pot` file is used to populate the `Audacity (development)` resource of the [unofficial Audacity Transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/klyok/audacity/).
